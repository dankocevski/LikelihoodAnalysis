# LikelihoodAnalysis

This module contains a collection of routines to perform likelihood analysis of gamma-ray data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

An overview of the detection, flux determination and spectral modeling of Fermi LAT sources through the use of the maximum likelihood optimization technique is outlined in further detail here:
